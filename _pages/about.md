I am a fourth year PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Prof. Ken Mai and [Prof. Franz Franchetti](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~franzf/).  My research interests are broadly in VLSI design and algorithms for applications in digital signal processing and machine learning.   

My work currently focuses on new design paradigms and implementation of hardware accelerators for FFT-based applications.

Prior to CMU, I graduated from Cornell University with my BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  During my undergrad I worked on novel methods for wireless localization.
