I am a final year PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Prof. Ken Mai and [Prof. Franz Franchetti](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~franzf/).  My research interests are broadly in hardware-software co-design, domain-specific accelerators, and VLSI/circuit design. I am particularly interested in applications or algorithms for scientific computing, digital signal processing, and machine learning. 

My work currently focuses on new design paradigms and tools for FFT-based hardware in current and emerging high performance systems.

Prior to CMU, I graduated from Cornell University with my BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  During my undergrad I worked on novel methods for wireless localization.
