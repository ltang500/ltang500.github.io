I am a first year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Prof. Ken Mai and [Prof. Franz Franchetti](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~franzf/).  My research interests are broadly in VLSI design and algorithms for applications in digital signal processing and machine learning.   

Prior to CMU, I graduated from Cornell University with my BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  During my undergrad, I worked with Prof. Christoph Studer on novel methods for wireless localization. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
